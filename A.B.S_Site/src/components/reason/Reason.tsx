          Modern backpacks don't have adequate load distribution, which can lead
          to back pain. 14,000 students are treated every year for back pain due
          to excessive weight in their bags. Backpacks aren’t as easily
          organized which causes students to take a trip to reorganize for their
          next class. Instead, students add an excessive amount of materials to
          their backpacks; 96% of students carry too much weight in their
          backpacks daily.

        <h1 className="display-5 title-2 text-left">Why our design?</h1>
        <p className="document-text">
          Our backpack design stands out because it merges simplicity with
          innovation, addressing the daily needs of users in a way that's both
          efficient and intuitive. While other designs have explored modular
          storage systems and smart tracking features, we’ve taken a more
          streamlined approach to minimize complexity and weight. By
          introducing adjustable, easy-to-swap cartridges and a simple
          handheld device for inputting your daily needs, we ensure that users
          can organize and prepare without rummaging or second-guessing.

        <p className="document-text">
          Unlike other products, which often rely on complex or bulky
          mechanisms, our focus is on keeping everything lightweight. We’ve
          analyzed similar patents and designs, many of which incorporated
          advanced features, but often at the cost of comfort or ease of use.
          By refining these ideas, we've created a solution that integrates
          seamlessly into your routine, without adding extra burden or
          requiring complex setups. 
        </p>
        <p className="document-text">
          We've carefully considered every feature
          to ensure that our design offers the most practical, user-friendly
          experience. From RFID tracking to automated notifications for class
          materials, we believe our design brings the right balance of
          technology and simplicity to everyday life.
